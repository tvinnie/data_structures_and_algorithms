# NOTE: swapcase() method

"""The swapcase() method makes a new string by swapping the cases of all letters within the source string: lower-case characters become upper-case, and vice versa.

All other characters remain untouched."""

# Demonstrating the swapcase() method:
print("I know that I know nothing.".swapcase())

print()

# Output: i KNOW THAT i KNOW NOTHING.
