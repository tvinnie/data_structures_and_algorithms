# NOTE: upper() method

# The upper() method makes a copy of the source string, replaces all lower-case letters with their upper-case counterparts, and returns the string as the result.

# Demonstrating the upper() method:
print("I know that I know nothing. Part 2.".upper())

# Output: I KNOW THAT I KNOW NOTHING. PART 2.
