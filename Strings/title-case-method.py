# NOTE: title() method

# The title() method performs a somewhat similar function â€“ it changes every word's first letter to upper-case, turning all other ones to lower-case.

# Demonstrating the title() method:
print("I know that I know nothing. Part 1.".title())

print()

# Output: I Know That I Know Nothing. Part 1.
