Useful Third-Party Packages
Being able to install and import third party libraries is useful, but to be an effective programmer you also need to know what libraries are available for you to use. People typically learn about useful new libraries from online recommendations or from colleagues. If you're a new Python programmer you may not have many colleagues, so to get you started here's a list of packages that are popular with engineers at Udacity.

IPython - A better interactive Python interpreter
requests  - Provides easy to use methods to make web requests. Useful for accessing web APIs.
