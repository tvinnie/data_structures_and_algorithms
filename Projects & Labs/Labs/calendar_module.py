"""
During this course, we took a brief look at the Calendar class. Your task now is to extend its functionality with a new method called count_weekday_in_year, which takes a year and a weekday as parameters, and then returns the number of occurrences of a specific weekday in the year.

Use the following tips:

Create a class called MyCalendar that extends the Calendar class;
Create the count_weekday_in_year method with the year and weekday parameters. The weekday parameter should be a value between 0-6, where 0 is Monday and 6 is Sunday. The method should return the number of days as an integer;
In your implementation, use the monthdays2calendar method of the Calendar class.

The following are the expected results:

Sample arguments

year=2019, weekday=0

Output
Expected output: 52
