# A queue is a data model characterized by the term FIFO: First In â€“ First Out.

"""
Your task is to implement the Queue class with two basic operations:

 * put(element), which puts an element at end of the queue;
 * get(), which takes an element from the front of the queue and returns it as the result (the queue cannot be empty to successfully perform it.)

Follow the hints:

 * use a list as your storage (just like we did with the stack)
 * put() should append elements to the beginning of the list, while get() should remove the elements from the end of the list;
 * define a new exception named QueueError (choose an exception to derive it from) and raise it when get() tries to operate on an empty list.
